The "Slot Machine" project is a console application written in Python that simulates the popular slot machine game. The player has the ability to spin the reels with different symbols and bet on different lines to win money.
Main Features:

    Random Symbol Generation: The program randomly generates symbols that appear on the reels. The symbols include various fruits such as cherries, oranges, lemons, grapes, watermelon, strawberries, pineapples and kiwis.

    Betting: the player has the option to bet on different lines and determine the stake on each line. There is a maximum and minimum stake restriction.

    Winnings: After each spin of the reels, the program evaluates whether the player has won. Wins are awarded for hitting the same symbols on a given line. There is a different value for each symbol.

    Balance: The player starts the game with a certain balance and can continue betting and spinning the reels until he decides to end the game.

    Console Interface: The project uses a console interface so the player can run the game and keep track of his balance and results.

Launching the Project:

    To launch the project, simply run the Python script Slot_machine_project.py.

    The player will be prompted to enter a starting balance and choose the number of lines and stake per line.

    After each spin of the reels, the program will show the result, informing the player of any winnings.

    The player can continue the game by betting more times or end the game by selecting the appropriate option.

Project Objective:

The goal of this project is to create an interactive slot machine simulation that allows the player to experience the excitement and fun of playing slots, while keeping track of their balance.
Technologies:

The project was written in Python and uses the random module to generate random results. The user interface is fully console-based, making it a simple and portable game.
